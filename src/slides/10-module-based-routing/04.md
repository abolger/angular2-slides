## Feature Route Modules

``` typescript
const employeeRoutes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'employees',
    component: EmployeeRootComponent,
    canActivate: [ AuthGuard ], // optional
    children: [
      { path: '', component: EmployeeListComponent },
      { path: 'new', component: EmployeeNewComponent },
    ]
  },
];
```

<aside class="notes">
Move all routes for a feature into a [feature]-routing.module.ts file. Define a base path for the root component. You 
can also optionally add guards which hook into lifecycle events. Our AuthGuard will ensure that a use is authenticated
before accessing a route.

Entries in the children array can optionally assign no component. This allows for assigning of additional guards. We 
don't need a component for this.

Guard Types: CanActivate, CanActivateChid, CanDeactivate, Resolve, CanLoad
